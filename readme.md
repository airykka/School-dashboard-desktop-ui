# School Dashboard

> This is an ongoing personal pet project and so far, I have just the desktop version of the dashboard ready. I go the UI design from dribble :)

## Quick Start/Installation

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
* Clone the repo

  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/airykka/School-dashboard-desktop-ui.git
  ```
* Then enter the folder ```School-dashboard-desktop-ui```

    ```shell
  cd School-dashboard-desktop-ui
  ```

* Then open the ```index.html``` file in your web browser on your local machine.

* ...and that's it! You should be able to view the HTML & CSS representation of the dashboard.

> Ongoing project...
